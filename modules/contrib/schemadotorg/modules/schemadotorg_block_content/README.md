### About Special Announcements (a.k.a. Notifications)

**General notes**

- Structured Data and Bing's implementation currently targets Covid-19 
  announcements, but it is a real-world implementation of the specification.
- The SpecialAnnouncement type will likely be used for other notifications in
  the future.
- The SpecialAnnouncement block content type has been added to the 
  [Schema.org Blueprints Hospital Starterkit](https://www.drupal.org/project/schemadotorg_starterkit_hospital) module.

**Implementation notes**

- Site-wide, section, or page-specific notifications should be implemented using content blocks.
- A content block can be mapped to [SpecialAnnouncement](https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement)
  or [WebContent](https://schema.org/WebContent)
- The [SpecialAnnouncement](https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement) properties 
  and JSON-LD should target Google's
- We can gradually implement more properties as needed

**Recommended properties**

- <https://schema.org/name>
- <https://schema.org/text>
- <https://schema.org/category>
- <https://schema.org/url>
- <https://schema.org/datePosted>
- <https://schema.org/expires>
- <https://schema.org/spatialCoverage>
- <https://schema.org/about>
